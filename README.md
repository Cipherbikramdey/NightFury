NightFury C2 Server

NightFury is a Python-based Command & Control (C2) server designed for educational, research, and defensive cybersecurity testing.
It demonstrates how remote administration, session management, and controlled client interactions work in a lab-only environment.

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This project is strictly for educational purposes, ethical hacking practice, and authorized environments only.
Do NOT deploy or use this tool on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

✨ Features

Displays IP, port, platform, and hostname

Clean attach / detach client sessions

Graceful shutdown & connection cleanup

📂 File Transfer

Upload files (supports custom & nested paths)

Download files from client

Base64 encoding for safe binary transfer

Automatic directory creation

Robust permission & path validation

🖥️ Remote Capabilities
